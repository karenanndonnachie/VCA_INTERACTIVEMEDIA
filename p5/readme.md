## [Mic_FFT_circleViz](https://karenanndonnachie.github.io/VCA_INTERACTIVEMEDIA/p5/mic_FFT_circle/index.html)
this sketch introduces the microphone as audio input, a sound analysis (bass, mid, treble) and a circular visual representation of the sound as it comes in through the mic.

## [Pointillism](https://karenanndonnachie.github.io/VCA_INTERACTIVEMEDIA/p5/karen_pointillism/)
this sketch gets the color value of underlying picture and draws small and large dots (depending on mouseX value) at random positions. After some time the picture is visible.
